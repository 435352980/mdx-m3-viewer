mdx-m3-viewer
=============

A WebGL viewer for MDX and M3 files used by the games Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 respectively.

Running compiler.rb creates a standalone minified JavaScript file that can be included to any HTML page.
To minify the GLSL shaders, use [glsl-minifier](https://github.com/flowtsohg/glsl-minifier).
To minify the resulting JavaScript, use the [Google Closure compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/).
Both options can be disabled or enabled in compiler.rb.

A live version can be seen on [Hiveworkshop](http://www.hiveworkshop.com) for which this viewer was made.
